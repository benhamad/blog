# Moving to a new blog

I received an email at somepoint in the last year to let me know that Heroku was
going to drop support for the "Dyno" that I have been using for the past couple
of years to host my blog.

> Thank you for being a Heroku user. Starting November 28, 2022, free Heroku

I didn't have the time for blogging (maybe I did, but it wasn't a priority :D ) so I
let it go dark.

Today I checked the domain -- which I still own -- and now it points to an
"Application not found" page. so I decided to move the blog to a github for the
time being.

Something that I don't think will require me to rewrite the blog engine again
(though it would be interesting to see how thing have changed it in the past
decade). The Ruby on Rails code for the old blog is still available on my Github
at [blog_old](https://github.com/benhamad/blog_old).

I will be moving all the posts from the old blog to this one over the next week.
Any maybe setup a Github page in the process?!!
